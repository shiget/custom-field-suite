== Description ==

Custom Field Suite (CFS) lets you visually create and manage custom fields.

= Features =
* Many field types: [text](http://uproot.us/docs/text/), [textarea](http://uproot.us/docs/textarea/), [wysiwyg](http://uproot.us/docs/wysiwyg/), [date](http://uproot.us/docs/date/), [color](http://uproot.us/docs/color/), [select](http://uproot.us/docs/select/), [file upload](http://uproot.us/docs/file-upload/), [user](http://uproot.us/docs/user/), [relationship](http://uproot.us/docs/relationship/), and [loop](http://uproot.us/docs/loop/)
* Field validation
* Drag-and-drop field management
* Unlimited nesting for loop fields
* Easily customize where each field group appears

**CFS is a fork of Advanced Custom Fields.** The main goals of this plugin are stability, performance, and avoiding feature bloat.

= Why use Custom Field Suite? =
* CFS is super easy to use.
* CFS is stable. We test all changes before releasing a new version.
* CFS is fast and uses minimal server resources.
* CFS works well with [Gravity Forms](http://uproot.us/how-to-save-gravity-forms-data-into-custom-field-suite/) by saving Gravity Forms entries as post items.
* CFS supports [adding your own field types](http://uproot.us/docs/creating-custom-field-types/).
* [CFS is on GitHub!](https://github.com/mgibbs189/custom-field-suite/)
