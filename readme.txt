== Description ==

Visually create and manage custom fields. Custom Field Suite is a fork of the [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) plugin.

= Field Types =
* Text (api returns text)
* Textarea (api returns text with `<br />`)
* Wysiwyg Editor (api returns html)
* Date (api returns text)
* True / False (api returns 0 or 1)
* Select (api returns array of values)
* Relationship (api returns array of post IDs)
* User (api returns array of user IDs)
* File Upload (api returns file url or attachment ID)
* Loop (a container for other fields, api returns array of arrays)

= More Features =
* Drag-n-drop field management UI that supports field hierarchy
* Customize where each field group will appear
* [Create your own field types](http://uproot.us/custom-field-suite/docs/custom-field-type/)
